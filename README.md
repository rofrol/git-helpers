Some git helper scripts for workflow

## Cherry-pick some changes but don't add it to index. Helpful when you have to modify some files constantly but don't want them to be commited

## Update some branch without switching to it

`git f <branch>`

## update specified branch, rebase on it, checkout to it, merge previous branch, push, delete prev branch on local and origin

`git m <branch>`

## Stash changes, checkout, stash pop

`git c <ref>`
